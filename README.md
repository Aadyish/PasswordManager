This project is a decentralised password manager that uses a smart contract running on citrea. The reason for making this project is because many of us have many passwords for different applications. Therefore having a password manager ensures that these passwords can be stored securely and can be accessed whenever needed. The reason for making a decentralised application was to ensure that data isn't stored in one central location which could put all the user's at risk if the data gets leaked. 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`
